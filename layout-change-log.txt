// CHANGE LOG
// DOCUMENTING CHANGES AND REASONS FOR CHANGES
// ALSO DOCUMENTING SHORTCOMINGS OF EACH ITERATION
// ADDED SMALL NOTES TO UNDERSTAND THOUGHT PROCESS



// REV 1

+ more ergonomic
+ dedicated esc / grave key
+ decent form factor

- not symmetrical
- shift kind of far
- spacebar positioning slightly uncomfortable
- a few too many empty keys (undecided how to hit those [like what fingers] and what to put there)

* first pass at 60% ergo non split
* modeled after TGR Alice slightly



// REV 2

+ removed right side extra column for symmetry -- also moves shift closer

- don't like how the MO(1) and Enter keys are so far away, very hard to hit
- also don't like the thumb keys in general are hard to hit
- q and p are hard to hit with pinky -- in general pinky keys slightly out of reach



// REV 3

+ addresses hard to reach pinky keys by lowering pinky columns
+ pinky columns in home position are also tilted now
+ angle of tilt is 12 degrees
+ thumb clusters are tilted as well to give better ergonomics for thumb
+ alt extended to 1.5u instead of 1u (for larger surface area for thumb to hit [chose 1.5u for keycap compatibility])

- thumb ctrl is hard to reach, probably swap for where alt is
- don't like how chording enter + space or MO(1) + backspace would be very difficult (for later potential stenography implementation)
- ctrl key position hard to reach in general, may remove ???
- pinky ctrl keys are still hard to reach
- oops, the j and l keys swapped in key placing

* of note, the main thumb keys have to be stabilized as it is, don't know if that will come into play later
* also noteworthy, a few design considerations will be based upon potential stenography usage, mainly how easy it is to chord thumb cluster keys
* as it stands, the keyboard form factor is also a consideration, but later revisions may not take that into account (going for a "flatter" wider and less tall shape [middle part has small protrusion -- to be expected and welcomed])



// REV 4

+ thumb ctrl is in accessible spot
+ ctrl + alt chording for key combinations such as ctrl + alt + shift + r for OBS record shortcut
+ pinky ctrl keys moved in, now space for additional key on the outside (infrequent use key)

- still don't like the alt key position, seems very hard to reach
- ambiguous use of the keys underneath x, c, <, and > keys. don't want to remove for form factor sake, but not really sure what to do with them yet
- keycaps call for 4 1.5u keys which is not easily attainable from a full size set



// REV 5

+ got rid of the two many 1.5u keys issue (now only 2 being used)
+ only 4 2u keys in use, meaning it's possible to use only a full size set for this board
+ chording of keys is very easy now (MO(1) + ctrl on left, enter + ctrl on right)
+ more thumb keys in use, mostly pretty accessible
+ just remembered that 1.25u keys are a thing, now 6 in use (out of 7 on full size set), all on thumb keys
+ all thumb keys are curved in a slight arc towards thumb

- not really sure what to do with the key on top of the vertical 1.25u
- duplicate ctrl keys on left side, not really sure what to think about that yet

* ideaology shift: thumb resting position should be more outward (relative to center of keyboard, inward if you are thinking relative to palm)
* more thumb keys used now, not sure if that is good or bad
* honestly way too many keys, don't feel like there's a need for that many, but it helps the form factor so :shrug:



// REV 6

+ middle finger column in line with ring and pointer finger column (better for games and numpad compatibility)
+ button underneath x and > keys switched to left and right windows key respectively
+ button on top of MO(1) switched to m (for games, m is usually map)

* this allows for esdf to comfortably be default position for games



// REV 7

+ pointer finger row raised a little because it's not a 0.25u difference from pointer homerow to one row over
+ thumb cluster second row shifted upwards to make overall form factor smaller (less of an angle in the case)
+ split right side caps and tab into 2 keys to allow for more layer keys (also keeps symmetry between left and right sides)
+ thumb cluster angle changed to match the pointer column change

- second row keys might be harder to reach now
- caps and tab will no longer "feel" like big keys, could be hard to get used to



// REV 8

+ just staggered the middle finger columns, but not by a whole 0.25u

* might make resting position for games (esdf) slightly more uncomfortable??? honestly not too much of a downside, it seems positive overall



// REV 9

+ shifted positions to prevent interference between caps with square corners (makes tolerances slightly higher; previously aligned based on rounded corners)
+ because of the slight shifts to prevent interference, angle of thumb cluster was decreased by 0.5u
+ added One Shot Layer key to left thumb cluster (easy access to fn keys)
+ added tab to right thumb cluster (to fix uncomfortable ring finger/pinky finger tab placement)

- widens overall keyboard with very slightly
- increases gap between angled keys and non angled keys (necessary to prevent interference, but slightly harder for fingers to reach)

* midline of keyboard should be 9.5u



// NOTE

* numbers get weird small decimal places, might make a tool to correct those
