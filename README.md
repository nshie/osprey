## Important Note:
This board is very much a prototype, and I would not recommend using the files without modification.

### Features:
- ergonomic wrist angle
- ortholinear columnar-stagger
- 60% form factor (~ish)
- thumb clusters for modifiers and chording
- kailh hotswap sockets
- USB-C

### Features to change:
- leds in the pcb are not properly implemented with capacitors, would not recommend building this board with the leds
- pcb uses 0805 diode pads; might have some difficulty finding them (0603 will work on the pcb)
